- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    The syntax matters!!!
    Honestly since it's not my first time using Java, It's more like a call back instead of learning a new language.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
For similarities, I think for several methods(if-else, loop), though codes are different, they share same concept or ideology that kind of thing. But in python, we don't need to strictly using any kinds of brackets to show these codes belongs there/is part of certain methods. We don't need to specify the type of variables. Java is like you are making a plan in details and running your code is like computer follows your plan to accomplish everything.


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Some questions I encountered when listing the outline/framework of this assignment:
        1. What is a static array? How can we create it? How to store things in it? 
            Static array is an array that the content inside doesn't change. Static means no changes happen
        2. How to check whether certain characters/mirror words are in the string or not?
            If else.
        3. How to replace the mirror words?
            Using replace method.
    After Monday, the major problem I encountered is that though I typed in code to replace mirror words correctly, the output are random stuffs. It actually reinforces how logic operators works. (if the first mirror word is not detected, the condition in if is false. Then, other word check will be skipped as they are included under that condition.)
